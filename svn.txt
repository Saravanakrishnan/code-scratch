IP_ADDRESS                    => Ip address of SVN Server
APPLICATION_NAME              => Repository Name (like Portfolio)
WORKING_PATH                  => trunk/APPLICATION_NAME
TAG_APPLICATION_WITH_VERSION  => tags/APPLICATION_NAME_V1
COMMENT                       => Comment for tagging


Note: This assumes that, your working files will be inside trunk and the tagging/versioned files will be there in tags folder.


************************************

Trunk   -> is a main branch recommended by Subversion, but you are in no way forced to 
           create it. You could call it 'main' or 'releases', or not have one at all!
Branch  -> represents a development effort. It should never be named after a resource 
           (like 'vonc_branch') but after:
            -> a purpose 'myProject_dev' or 'myProject_Merge'
            -> a release perimeter 'myProjetc1.0_dev'or myProject2.3_Merge' or 'myProject6..2_Patch1'...
Tag     -> is a snapshot of files in order to easily get back to that state. The problem
           is that tag and branch is the same in Subversion. And I would definitely 
           recommend the paranoid approach:
          
Note    -> A tag is final. Its content should never change. NEVER. Ever. You forgot a
          line in the release note? Create a new tag. Obsolete or remove the old one
